MessagePack-based service for jb-serve.

Use MessagePackService instead of Service when your code produces stdout output
(progress bars, logging, etc.) that would interfere with the REPL protocol.

    """
    Service that uses MessagePack queue transport instead of REPL.
    
    Use this for services that:
    - Have libraries that print to stdout (tqdm, diffusers, etc.)
    - Need verbose logging during execution
    - Do long-running operations with progress output
    
    Example:
        from jb_service import MessagePackService, method
        
        class ImageGenerator(MessagePackService):
            def setup(self):
                # Progress bars are fine - they don't interfere

            def generate(self, prompt: str) -> dict:
                # tqdm progress bars are fine
                result = self.pipe(prompt)
